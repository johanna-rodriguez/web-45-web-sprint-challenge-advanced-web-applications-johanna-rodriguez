Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.


1. Explain what a token is used for.

It is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created.


2. What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?

- Require Injection & Input Validation
- Encrypt your data
- Use Exception Management
- Apply Authentication, Role Management & Access Control
- Don't Forget Hosting/Service-Focused Measures
- Avoid Security Misconfigurations
- Implement HTTPS (and Redirect All HTTP Traffic to HTTPS)
- Include Auditing & Logging

3. Describe how web servers work.

At the most basic level, whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the correct (hardware) web server, the (software) HTTP server accepts the request, finds the requested document, and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.


4. Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.

The actions CRUD: Create, read, update and delete, refers to map to all of the major functions implemented in relational database applications. In fact, each letter maps to a standard SQL statement.
